The manuscript I sent to you yesterday only work for Gaussian 03 version. Now I updated it to Gaussian 09 version and the third code 

need small memory and run fast, but you need install python 3.5  and pyparsing module.

In order to use pyparsing, you have to install it in your python library, and this is the website showing how to do that.

Please notice this code only reads from the second point of IRC calculation. Also please notice it doesn't include all type of atoms in its label:

number_to_label = {'1': 'H', '6': 'C', '7': 'N', '8': 'O'}

If you have other type of atoms you can add it by yourself.

The other piece of code, gaussircdata_09.py, doesn't need external library and it reads all points of IRC except your transition state point

because I think sometimes people may not want to read it. Again it can read transition state by simply changing one line of code:

from "loop = []" to "loop = [1]".
